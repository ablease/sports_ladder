###Version 0: Planning Stages

In our teams initial scrum, the rules of a ladder tournament were discussed, in order to define the boundaries of
the app. 

Some initial features were discussed, and some scope for extension and imporvement for those basic features. User stories were written for each of these features and catagorised by MVP stages, and published on TREOLL (INSRT RELLO LINK HERE) Additionally a versions diagram was made to create versions of the app ranging from basic to 
advanced features. Versions and their features shown below
